<br><br>

# **Description**

Jelly Desktop is an improved alternative to [Jellyfin Desktop](https://github.com/jellyfin-archive/jellyfin-desktop) app which is no longer supported. Through it, users can connect to servers with Jellyfin and use all its features, even if they don't know its IP address and port.

<br>

### **Technologies used**

Like its older counterpart, Jelly Desktop was created using [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/). We used [electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder) to build the app, and the [electron-updater](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-updater) for automatic updates.

We also used pure CSS in it. The app is fully responsive and has a consistent design with the Jellyfin browser version.

<br>

### **General operations of the app**

During the first run, the program will ask the user for the IP address, port and display all servers with Jellyfin in the local network. After the connection is established, the data will be saved and the user won't have to enter it again the next time the app is started.
