# **Description**

Jelly Desktop is an improved alternative to [Jellyfin Desktop](https://github.com/jellyfin-archive/jellyfin-desktop) app which is no longer supported. Through it, users can connect to servers with Jellyfin and use all its features, even if they don't know its IP address and port.

<br>

### **Technologies used**
Like its older counterpart, Jelly Desktop was created using [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/). We used [electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder) to build the app, and the [electron-updater](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-updater) for automatic updates.
<br>
The app is fully responsive and has a consistent design with the Jellyfin browser version.

<br>

# **Known Issues**
- ### **Windows**
  - The system gives a warning (screenshot below) when trying to run the installer. This is due to the lack of a certificate.
    <br>
    To overcome this problem, click: `More info` and then `Run anyway`. <br><br>

- ### **macOS**
  - When Jelly Desktop is launched for the first time, the system displays a window (screenshot below) that prevents the app from opening. To fix it, go to: `System Preferences => Security & Privacy => General`. <br><br>
    When opening the program, you'll be presented with the option `Open Anyway`, which you must select to use our project. Then you only need to confirm by clicking the `Open` button. This problem only occurs after installation and is caused by missing Apple certificate. <br><br>
